# Rock, Paper, Scissors (Javascript)
## Description
This project utilizes Javascript to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer. I created this project to test out how a game would function using only Javascript. I learned that it is possible to make a game as simple as this, and will see if I can utilize Javascript in the future to make something more complex or dynamic for a website.
